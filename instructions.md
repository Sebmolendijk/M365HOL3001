# Microsoft 365 Cloud App Security
[ðŸ”™](#introduction)

This lab will guide you through some of the Microsoft Cloud App Security
(MCAS) capabilities.

We expect you to already have experience with MCAS deployment and
configuration. In the different sections, you will be asked to fulfill
some tasks for which you will receive the requirements but not a step by
step guide to accomplish this task. A lab answer key document can be
provided to those needing it.

# Cloud Discovery
[ðŸ”™](#microsoft-365-cloud-app-security)

### Estimated time to complete
30 min

Continuous reports in Cloud Discovery analyze all logs that are
forwarded from your network using Cloud App Security. They provide
improved visibility over all data, and automatically identify anomalous
use using either the Machine Learning anomaly detection engine or by
using custom policies that you define.
To use this capability, you will perform in this lab the configuration
and troubleshooting of the Cloud Discovery feature.
===
## Configure and test continuous reports

1. []  By following the procedure provided in the documentation
    (<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/discovery-docker-ubuntu>)
    , deploy a new log collector on **LinuxVM**. The
    receiver type must be **FTP** and the data source must be **SQUID**
    (Common).

    You are also asked to anonymize the usernames.
    Use Putty on **AdminPC** to open a session to
    **LinuxVM** to perform the configuration.

1. []  To validate your configuration, upload a SQUID sample log to your log collector with the **Win SCP** client installed on
    **AdminPC**.
    Sample logs are downloadable in MCAS when creating new sources.
	
	![g5txg1zn.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/g5txg1zn.jpg)

	![pdp28e19.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/pdp28e19.jpg)
  
1. []    In WinSCP, you have to create a new connection using the credentials
    provided during the log collector creation, its IP address and
    port 21. Then, you upload the logs into the folder named as the data
    source you created in MCAS.
	
	![bgyxrnmh.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/bgyxrnmh.jpg)

1. []  After uploading your logs, verify the processing status in MCAS
    using the Governance log. Verify also the "last data received"
    status of your data source in the "Automatic log upload" status.

1. [] After validating that your logs have been successfully uploaded and
    processed by MCAS, you will not see directly the analysis of your
    data. Why? (hint: verify the "Set up Cloud Discovery" documentation
    page).
===
## Integrate MCAS with Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection

Microsoft Cloud App Security leverages the traffic information collected
by Windows Defender ATP about the cloud apps and services being accessed
from IT-managed Windows 10 machines. This enables you to run Cloud
Discovery on any machine in the corporate network, using public wifi,
while roaming and over remote access. It also enables machine-based
investigation.

To complete this lab, you have to onboard your Windows 10 devices as
explained in the documentation
(<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/wdatp-integration>).
Not all Windows 10 devices will provide your Cloud Discovery data. Why?
What are the prerequisites to use this native integration?

Once the integration is complete, you will have a new continuous report
in the Discovery reports.

## How to troubleshoot the Docker log collector

In this task, you will review possible troubleshooting steps to identify
issues in automatic logs upload from the log collector.

There are several things to test at different locations: in the log
collector, in MCAS, at the network level.

### Verify the log collector (container) status

On @lab.VirtualMachine(AdminPC).SelectLink, open a session on Putty to **LinuxVM** and use on the following commands:

*sudo -i*

Â 

*docker stats*

This command will show you the status of the log collector instance:

![CONTAINER ID 2d7cadgfS4a1 13.14\* CPU 1.22\* MEM USAGE / LIMIT 187
.1MiB / 1.39GiB NET I/o 10.gMB / 3 .23MB](vl5158cy.jpg)

Â 

*docker logs \--details name\_of\_your\_log\_collector *

This command will show you the logs from the log collector to verify if
it encountered errors when initiating:



![rootaubuntu-srt: \'hame,\'seb 5 \--dzt.ei15 Setting ftp configuration

Â 

To go further in the troubleshooting, you can connect to the log
collector container to investigates the different logs, using the
following command:\
*docker exec -it name\_of\_log\_collector bash*

You can then explore the container filesystem and inspect the
**/var/adallom** directory. This directory is where you will investigate
issues with the syslog or ftp logs being sent to the collector\
![ovjlyn26.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/ovjlyn26.jpg)

-   **/adallom/ftp/discovery**: this folder contains the data source
    folders where you send the log files for automated upload. This is
    also the default folder when logging into the collector with FTP
    credentials.

-   **/adallom/syslog/discovery**: if you setup the log collector to
    receive syslog messages, this is where the flat file of aggregated
    messages will reside until it is uploaded.

-   **/adallom/discoverylogsbackup**: this folder contains the last file
    that was sent to MCAS. This is useful for looking at the raw log in
    case there are parsing issues.

To validate that logs are correctly received from the network appliance,
you can also verify the **/var/log/pure-ftpd** directory and check the
transfer log:
![erx39v7i.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/erx39v7i.jpg)

Now, move to the **/var/log/adallom** directory.
![0h029uih.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/0h029uih.jpg)

-   **/var/log/adallom/columbus**: this folder is where you will find
    log files useful for troubleshooting issues with the collector
    sending files. In the log-archive folder you can copy previous logs
    compressed as .tar.gz files off the collector to send to support.

-   **/var/log/adallom/columbusInstaller**: this is where you will
    investigate issues with the collector itself. You will find here
    logs related to the configuration and bootstrapping of the
    collector. For example, trace.log will show you the bootstrapping
    process:
    ![ks4ttuuq.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/ks4ttuuq.jpg)

Â 

Â 

### Verify the connectivity between the log collector and MCAS

An easy way to test this is to download a sample of your appliance logs
from MCAS and use WinSCP to connect to the log collector to upload that
log and see if it gets uploaded to MCAS.

Â 

Upload the logs in the folder named by your source:

![bqhxmpns.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/bqhxmpns.jpg)

Â 

Then, check in MCAS the status:

![21pseval.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/21pseval.jpg)

Â 

![mt0o095m.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/mt0o095m.jpg)

Â 

If the log stays in the source folder, then you know you probably have a
connection issue between the log collector and MCAS.

Another way to validate the connection is to log into the container like
in the previous task and then run *netstat -a* to check if we see
connections to MCAS:![rxvauw6e.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/rxvauw6e.jpg)

# Threat Detection
[ðŸ”™](#microsoft-365-cloud-app-security)

### Estimated time to complete
20 min

Cloud App Security provides several [threats detection
policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/anomaly-detection-policy)
using machine learning and **user behavior analytics** to detect
suspicious activities across your different applications. After an
initial learning period, Cloud App Security will start alerting you when
suspicious actions like activity from anonymous IP addresses, infrequent
country, suspicious IP addresses, impossible travel, ransomware
activity, suspicious inbox forwarding configuration or unusual file
download are detected.

In addition to those policies, you can create your own policies, like
the ones on the next page, that you must create for this lab.
===
## Policies

### Exchange Online -- monitor mail forwarding configuration

This policy allows you to monitor admin and users mail forwarding
configuration. This policy is covering extra scenarios than the built-in
one.

**Activities to monitor:**

  |App               |Activity category              |Activity
  |----------------- |------------------------------ |---------------
  |Exchange Online   |Create forwarding inbox rule   |New-InboxRule
  |Exchange Online   |Edit mailbox forwarding        |Set-Mailbox
  |Exchange Online   |Edit forwarding inbox rule     |Set-InboxRule

As creating this kind of rules is part of the daily operations in a
company, we could recommend scoping the monitoring to **sensitive
groups** of users to monitor but this is not required for this lab.

![deg5ncg3.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/deg5ncg3.jpg)

### Exchange Online - add user to Exchange administrator role

This policy monitors when a user is added to an Exchange management role
group.

Although this action is usually legit, providing visibility on it is
usually required by security teams.

**Activities to monitor:**
  |App               |Activity category             |Activity
  |----------------- |---- 							|---------------------
  |Exchange Online   |N/A   						|Add-RoleGroupMember

Optionally, you could add as a condition "if IP address category is not
in Corporate".

![ao3du4ms.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/ao3du4ms.jpg)

### Exchange Online - Add management role assignment

This rule monitors possible management role assignments to a management
group.

For example, when someone is adding impersonation capabilities to a
group used to migrate mailboxes to Office 365.

Details about Exchange permissions and roles can be found [at this
address](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo).

**Activities to monitor:**
  |App               |Activity category                   |Activity
  |----------------- |----------------------------------- |---------------------
  |Exchange Online   |Add impersonation role assignment   |New-ManagementRoleAssignment

![rilw99v2.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/rilw99v2.jpg)

### Exchange Online - New delegated access to sensitive mailbox

This policy monitors when a delegate is added to sensitive mailboxes,
like your CEO or HR team mailboxes or sensitive shared mailboxes.

We monitor two kinds of delegation: at the mailbox level, when an admin
performs the action, and at the client level, when delegation for
folders are added.

**Note**: Exchange logs can take some time before being available,
leading to some delay before the detection.

**Activities to monitor:**

We recommend scoping this policy to specific users only, to avoid too
many alerts, but this is not required for this lab.

  |App               |Activity category                   |Activity
  |----------------- |----------------------------------- |---------------------
  |Exchange Online   |Add mailbox folder permission   	  |Add-MailboxFolderPermission
  |Exchange Online   |Add permission to mailbox       	  |Add-MailboxPermission

![6kcy2xki.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/6kcy2xki.jpg)

### OneDrive -- Ownership granted to another user

This policy helps you to detect when someone is granted full access to
somebody OneDrive for Business site.

**Activities to monitor:**

  |App               |Activity category                   |Activity
  |----------------- |----------------------------------- |---------------------
  |OneDrive   		 |Add site collection administrator   |SiteCollectionAdminAdded

![rb4fqb83.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/rb4fqb83.jpg)

### 3rd party apps delegations

This policy helps you to detect new external apps for which users are
granting access to the select app (Office 365, G Suite, ...).

Detecting those delegations will help in the case of cloud ransomware,
or possible data exfiltration.

**Activities to monitor:**

We will monitor when an uncommon app is granted medium or high
permission level:

![mszki5q9.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/mszki5q9.jpg)

### Investigation in MCAS

Now that we have created those policies, we are going to investigate on
the alerts.

As your environments auditing might not be configured yet and will take
up to 24h before being enabled, those investigations will be performed
in the environment provided by your instructor.

Review the alerts in the environment and investigate to identify the
users and the malicious activities performed.

# Management
[ðŸ”™](#microsoft-365-cloud-app-security)

### Estimated time to complete
30 min

### Manage admin access 

For this task, you are asked to delegate admin access to other users,
without adding them to the Global Admin management role.

Documentation:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/manage-admins>

#### Delegate user group administration

You are asked to delegate the management of MCAS for US employees to a
new administrator.

By following the explanations in the documentation you have to:

1.  Create a new administrator account "mcasAdminUS"

2.  Create a new Azure AD group "US employees" containing a couple of
    your test users (not your admin account)

3.  Delegate that group management in MCAS to "mcasAdminUS"

4.  Connect to MCAS with "mcasAdminUS" and compare the activities,
    alerts and actions that this admin can perform

#### Delegate MCAS administration to an external admin

As a Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs), you are asked by your
customer how you could access their environment to manage their alerts
in the Cloud App Security portal.

As the MCAS admin for your company, work with the person next to you to
configure an external access for the Managed Security Service Provider.

### MCAS PowerShell module introduction

To help administrators interact with MCAS in a programmatic way, two
Microsoft employees created a non-official PowerShell module for Cloud
App Security. For this lab, you will install this module and discover
the available cmdlets.

Note: the module relies on the Cloud App Security API. You can find its
documentation in the MCAS portal.

![f847xhzx.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/f847xhzx.jpg)

The module is available in the PowerShell gallery and can be installed
using the *Install-Module mcas* command.

![6j16dgs2.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/6j16dgs2.jpg)

More information on the module is available on GitHub:
<https://github.com/powershellshock/MCAS-Powershell>

After installing the module, read how to connect to MCAS in the
PowerShell help and start exploring the cmdlets.

Hint: you'll have to create an API token in Cloud App Security.

![0x2tzeqd.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/0x2tzeqd.jpg)

Using PowerShell:

1.  Review the list of MCAS administrators and when they were granted
    those permissions

2.  Review your security alerts and close them in bulk

3.  Download a sample SQUID log and send it to MCAS as a snapshot
    report.

4.  In the portal, in Discovery, tag some apps as unsanctioned and
    generate a blocking script for your appliance to block access to
    those apps.

5.  You are asked to define corporate IP's in MCAS. Subnets go from
    10.50.50.0/24 to 10.50.80.0/24

# Exercise 1: Configuring AIP Scanner for Discovery
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

Even before configuring an AIP classification taxonomy, customers can scan and identify files containing sensitive information based on the built-in sensitive information types included in the Microsoft Classification Engine.  

![ahwj80dw.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/ahwj80dw.jpg)

Often, this can help drive an appropriate level of urgency and attention to the risk customers face if they delay rolling out AIP classification and protection.  

In this exercise, we will install the AIP scanner and run it against repositories in discovery mode.  Later in this lab (after configuring labels and conditions) we will revisit the scanner to perform automated classification, labeling, and protection of sensitive documents.

	+++@lab.CloudCredential(81).Username+++
	
	+++@lab.CloudCredential(81).Password+++

1. [] Next, we must build the PasswordProfile object to define the parameters needed when creating the password for the cloud service account.  This is done by running the commands below.

    +++$PasswordProfile = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.PasswordProfile+++

    +++$PasswordProfile.Password = "Somepass1"+++

    +++$PasswordProfile.ForceChangePasswordNextLogin = $false+++

1. [] Now, we can create the cloud service account using the command below.

    +++New-AzureADUser -AccountEnabled $True -DisplayName "AIP Scanner Cloud Service" -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile -MailNickName "AIPScanner" -UserPrincipalName "AIPScanner@@lab.CloudCredential(81).TenantName"+++

# Installing the AIP Scanner Service
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

The first step in configuring the AIP Scanner is to install the service and connect the database.  This is done with the Install-AIPScanner cmdlet that is provided by the AIP Client software.  The AIPScanner service account has been pre-staged in Active Directory for convenience.

1. [] At the PowerShell prompt, type +++$SQL = "Scanner01"+++
1. [] Next, type +++Install-AIPScanner -SQLServerInstance $SQL+++ and press **Enter**.

# Creating Azure AD Applications for the AIP Scanner
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

Now that you have installed the scanner bits, you need to get an Azure AD token for the scanner service account to authenticate so that it can run unattended. This requires registering both a Web app and a Native app in Azure Active Directory.  The commands below will do this in an automated fashion rather than needing to go into the Azure portal directly.

1. [] At the PowerShell prompt, **type the commands below** and press **Enter** to create a new Web App Registration and Service Principal in Azure AD.

   ```
   New-AzureADApplication -DisplayName AIPOnBehalfOf -ReplyUrls http://localhost
   $WebApp = Get-AzureADApplication -Filter "DisplayName eq 'AIPOnBehalfOf'"
   New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId $WebApp.AppId
   $WebAppKey = New-Guid
   $Date = Get-Date
   New-AzureADApplicationPasswordCredential -ObjectId $WebApp.ObjectID -startDate $Date -endDate $Date.AddYears(1) -Value $WebAppKey.Guid -CustomKeyIdentifier "AIPClient"
	```
1. [] Next, we must build the permissions object for the Native App Registration.  This is done using the commands below.
   
   ```
   $AIPServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -All $true | ? {$_.DisplayName -eq 'AIPOnBehalfOf'}
   $AIPPermissions = $AIPServicePrincipal | select -expand Oauth2Permissions
   $Scope = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ResourceAccess" -ArgumentList $AIPPermissions.Id,"Scope"
   $Access = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.RequiredResourceAccess"
   $Access.ResourceAppId = $WebApp.AppId
   $Access.ResourceAccess = $Scope
	```
1. [] Next, we will use the object created above to create the Native App Registration.
   
   ```
   New-AzureADApplication -DisplayName AIPClient -ReplyURLs http://localhost -RequiredResourceAccess $Access -PublicClient $true
   $NativeApp = Get-AzureADApplication -Filter "DisplayName eq 'AIPClient'"
   New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId $NativeApp.AppId
	```
   
1. [] Finally, we will output the Set-AIPAuthentication command by running the commands below.
   
   ```
   "Set-AIPAuthentication -WebAppID " + $WebApp.AppId + " -WebAppKey " + $WebAppKey.Guid + " -NativeAppID " + $NativeApp.AppId | Out-File C:\Scripts\Set-AIPAuthentication.txt
	Start c:\Scripts\Set-AIPAuthentication.txt
	```
1. [] Copy the command to the clipboard.
1. [] Click on the Start menu and type +++PowerShell+++, right-click on the PowerShell program, and click **Run as a different user**.

	![zgt5ikxl.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/zgt5ikxl.jpg)

1. [] When prompted, enter the username and password below and click **OK**.

	+++Contoso\AIPScanner+++ 

	+++Somepass1+++

1. [] Paste the copied **Set-AIPAuthentication** command into this window and run it.
1. [] When prompted, enter the username and password below:

	+++AIPScanner@@lab.CloudCredential(81).TenantName+++

	+++Somepass1+++

# Configuring Repositories
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

In this task, we will configure repositories to be scanned by the AIP scanner.  As previously mentioned, these can be any type of CIFS file shares including NAS devices sharing over the CIFS protocol.  Additionally, On premises SharePoint 2010, 2013, and 2016 document libraries and lists (attachements) can be scanned.  You can even scan entire SharePoint sites by providing the root URL of the site.  There are several optional 

> [!NOTE] SharePoint 2010 is only supported for customers who have extended support for that version of SharePoint.

The next task is to configure repositories to scan.  These can be on-premises SharePoint 2010, 2013, or 2016 document libraries and any accessible CIFS based share.

1. [] In the PowerShell window on Scanner01 run the commands below

    ```
    Add-AIPScannerRepository -Path http://Scanner01/documents -SetDefaultLabel Off
	```
	```
	Add-AIPScannerRepository -Path \\Scanner01\documents -SetDefaultLabel Off
    ```
	>[!Knowledge] Notice that we added the **-SetDefaultLabel Off** switch to each of these repositories.  This is necessary because our Global policy has a Default label of **General**.  If we did not add this switch, any file that did not match a condition would be labeled as General when we do the enforced scan.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](00niixfd.jpg)
1. [] To verify the repositories configured, run the command below.
	
    ```
    Get-AIPScannerRepository
    ```

# Running Sensitive Data Discovery
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

1. [] Run the commands below to run a discovery cycle.

    ```
	Set-AIPScannerConfiguration -DiscoverInformationTypes All -Enforce Off
	```
	```
	Start-AIPScan
    ```

	> [!Knowledge] Note that we used the DiscoverInformationTypes -All switch before starting the scan.  This causes the scanner to use any custom conditions that you have specified for labels in the Azure Information Protection policy, and the list of information types that are available to specify for labels in the Azure Information Protection policy.  Although the scanner will discover documents to classify, it will not do so because the default configuration for the scanner is Discover only mode.
 	
1. [] Right-click on the **Windows** button in the lower left-hand corner and click on **Event Viewer**.

# Exercise 2: Configuring Azure Information Protection Policy
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

This exercise demonstrates using the Azure Information Protection blade in the Azure portal to configure policies and sub-labels.  We will create a new sub-label and configure protection and then modify an existing sub-label.  We will also create a label that will be scoped to a specific group.  

We will next configure AIP Global Policy to use the General sub-label as default, and finally, we will configure a scoped policy to use the new scoped label by default for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint while still using General as default for Outlook.
===
# Creating, Configuring, and Modifying Sub-Labels
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

In this task, we will configure a label protected for internal audiences that can be used to help secure sensitive data within your company.  By limiting the audience of a specific label to only internal employees, you can dramatically reduce the risk of unintentional disclosure of sensitive data and help reduce the risk of successful data exfiltration by bad actors.  However, there are times when external collaboration is required, so we will configure a label to match the name and functionality of the Do Not Forward button in Outlook.  This will allow users to more securely share sensitive information outside the company to any recipient.  By using the name Do Not Forward, the functionality will also be familiar to what previous users of AD RMS or Azure RMS may have used in the past.

# Configuring Advanced Policy Settings
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

There are many advanced policy settings that are useful to tailor your Azure Information Protection deployment to the needs of your environment.  In this task, we will cover one of the settings that is very complimentary when using scoped policies that have a protected default label.  Because the Legal Scoped Policy we created in the previous task uses a protected default label, we will be adding an alternate default label for Outlook to provide a more palatable user experience for those users.

1. [] In the Azure Information Protection blade, under **classifications** on the left, click on **Labels** and then click on the **General** label.

# Defining Recommended and Automatic Conditions
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

One of the most powerful features of Azure Information Protection is the ability to guide your users in making sound decisions around safeguarding sensitive data.  This can be achieved in many ways through user education or reactive events such as blocking emails containing sensitive data. However, helping your users to properly classify and protect sensitive data at the time of creation is a more organic user experience that will achieve better results long term.  In this task, we will define some basic recommended and automatic conditions that will trigger based on certain types of sensitive data.

1. [] Under **classifications** on the left, click **Labels** then expand **Confidential**, and click on **Contoso Internal**.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](jyw5vrit.jpg)

# Exercise 2: Client and Exchange Configuration
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

Now that we have defined some basic AIP Policies, we need to configure some clients to demonstrate the Discovery, Classification, and Protection capabilities of Azure Information Protection.  In this exercise, we will configure Office 365 Applications for 3 test users to demonstrate these policy actions.  

Office 365 and the latest GA AIP Client (1.37.19.0) have already been installed on these systems to save time in this lab.  In your production environment, you will need to install the AIP Client manually for testing or using an Enterprise Deployment Tool like System Center Configuration Manager for widespread deployment.

We will also be disabling a mail flow rule in the Exchange Admin Center to allow mail to be sent outside the tenant.  This will allow us to test Do Not Forward and Office 365 Message Encryption scenarios.

# Testing Recommended and Automatic Classification
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

In this task, we will test the configured recommended and automatic conditions we defined in Exercise 1.  Recommended conditions can be used to help organically train your users to classify sensitive data appropriately and provides a method for testing the accuracy of your dectections prior to switching to automatic classification.  Automatic conditions should be used after thorough testing or with items you are certain need to be protected. Although the examples used here are fairly simple, in production these could be based on complex regex statements or only trigger when a specific quantity of sensitive data is present.

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client03).SelectLink and @[Click here](`"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\WINWORD.EXE"`) to launch **Microsoft Word**.
1. [] In Microsoft Word, create a new **Blank document** and type +++My AMEX card number is 344047014854133. The expiration date is 09/28, and the CVV is 4368+++ and **save** the document.

	> [!NOTE] This card number is a fake number that was generated using the Credit Card Generator for Testing at https://developer.paypal.com/developer/creditCardGenerator/.  The Microsoft Classification Engine uses the Luhn Algorithm to prevent false positives so when testing, please make sure to use valid numbers.

1. [] Notice that you are prompted with a recommendation to change the classification to Confidential \ Contoso Internal. Click on **Change now** to set the classification and protect the document.

# Exercise 6: Classification, Labeling, and Protection with the Azure Information Protection Scanner
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

The Azure Information Protection scanner allows you to  classify and protect sensitive information stored in on-premises CIFS file shares and SharePoint sites.  

In this exercise, you will use the information gathered in Exercise 1 to map sensitive data types discovered to automatic classification rules.  After that, we will run the AIP Scanner in enforce mode to classify and protect the identified sensitive data.

===


# Configuring Automatic Conditions
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)
![52a7iwuj.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/52a7iwuj.jpg)
Now that we know what types of sensitive data we need to protect, we will configure some automatic conditions (rules) that the scanner can use to classify and protect content.

1. [] Switch back to @lab.VirtualMachine(Scanner01).SelectLink and open the browser that is logged into the Azure Portal.

1. [] Under **classifications** on the left, click **Labels** then expand **Confidential**, and click on **Contoso Internal**.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](jyw5vrit.jpg)
1. [] In the Label: Contoso Internal blade, scroll down to the **Configure conditions for automatically applying this label** section, and click on **+ Add a new condition**.

	![cws1ptfd.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/cws1ptfd.jpg)
1. [] In the Condition blade, in the **Select information types** search box, type +++SSN+++ and check the box next to the 3 **Social Security Number** entries.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](a6dfnuyz.jpg)
1. [] Click **Save** in the Condition blade and **OK** to the Save settings prompt.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](41o5ql2y.jpg)
1. [] In the Label : Contoso Internal blade, under **Select how this label is applied: automatically or recommended to user**, click **Automatic**.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](1ifaer4l.jpg)

1. [] Click **Save** in the Label: Contoso Internal blade and **OK** to the Save settings prompt.

# Enforcing Configured Rules
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)
![52a7iwuj.jpg](https://github.com/kemckinnmsft/AIPLAB/blob/master/Content/52a7iwuj.jpg)
In this task, we will se the AIP scanner to enforce the conditions we set up in the previous task and have it rerun on all files using the Start-AIPScan -Reset command.

1. [] Run the commands below to run an enforced scan using defined policy.

    ```
	Set-AIPScannerConfiguration -Enforce On -DiscoverInformationTypes PolicyOnly
	```
	```
	Start-AIPScan -Reset
    ```

	> [!HINT] Note that this time we used the DiscoverInformationTypes -PolicyOnly switch before starting the scan. This will have the scanner only evaluate the conditions we have explicitly defined in conditions.  This increases the effeciency of the scanner and thus is much faster.  After reviewing the event log we will see the result of the enforced scan.

# Reviewing Protected Documents
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

Now that we have Classified and Protected documents using the scanner, we can review the documents we looked at previously to see their change in status.

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink.
 
2. [] @[Click here](`cmd.exe/c start shell:AppsFolder\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe!MicrosoftEdge -private http://Scanner01/documents`) to navigate to ***http://Scanner01/documents***. Provide the credentials +++LabUser+++ and +++Pa$$w0rd+++ if prompted.
 
	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](hipavcx6.jpg)
3. [] Open one of the Contoso Purchasing Permissions documents or Run For The Cure spreadsheets.
 
 	
	
	> [!NOTE] Observe that the same document is now classified as Confidential \ Contoso Internal. You can also see these same documents on a file share at \\Scanner01\documents in their new protected state.
